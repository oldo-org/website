<h1>Eat food</h1>

<p>
We ingest nutrients by eating organic substances originating from other life forms, like plants and animals. We need food as a source of energy and for cell growth.
</p>

<p>
Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of food for nearly all life on earth: Plants combine water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sun light into sugar, the basic building block of all carbohydrates.
