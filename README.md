# website

This will become my only website.
Its original content is on a server in my basement.

I might replicate it to cloud services for backup and 
maybe for bandwidth, but never depend on such services'

I like to migrate and evolve content from
- my IT blog
- my funfairview blog
- eigenlyrik and enderung
- resume website
- basics of life
- board games instructions

Also I want to write new pages about
- gardening and sustainable lifestyle
- intentional computer programming
- books I have read (summary, thoughts)
- music and bands I like

The source content has the form of
- a directory heirarchy
- posts/articles as html pages
- emojis that symlink to dirs and pages
- tag directories with symlinks to pages
- media files (images, maybe sounds)

The site will be generated from the source
- For each directory index.html links to all files and sub-dirs
- Navigation like up, back is left to browser UI
- Front page with a set of links to 
-- recently updates pages (by html file timestamps)
-- recently added pages
-- dirs with most pages (by html file count)
-- tags with most pages
-- CSS stylesheets for all pages ("site")  and indexes
-- Links to dirs and pages show emoji and name of target
-- mailto links on each index.html
-- Simplicity!
