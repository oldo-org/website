<h1>Morabaraba / 12 Men’s Morris</h1>

<img src="morabaraba.svg" class="right" style="width: 30%;"/>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
 <li>2 Players - <b>12</b> pieces each - black / white</li>
 <li>Pieces may sit on <b>24</b> points (where lines meet)</li>
 <li>Game begins with empty game board as shown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
Build “<b>mills</b>” to remove opponent’s pieces, or lock them in.
The game ends when one player has only 2 pieces left or is locked 
in and cannot move anymore.
</p>

<h2>Closing a Mill</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>3 pieces of the same colour on a straight line</b> are called a "<b>mill</b>".</li>
<li>
Whenever you newly create such a pattern, you have "closed a mill"
and immediately <b>remove</b> one of the opponent's pieces from the board.
Removed pieces are excluded from the game and cannot not be used again.
</li>
<li><b>Note</b>: Pieces that are themselves part of a mill can only be removed if 
no other pieces are available.</li>
<li>If you manage to close 2 mills at once, you still only remove one piece.
</ul>
<p>
The closing of a mill may occur at any time throughout the following game phases:
</p>

<h2>Phase 1 - Placing pieces</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Take turns placing your pieces on any empty board positions.</li>
 <li>Continue until all pieces have been placed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 2 - Moving pieces</h2>
<p>
Now on each turn move one of your pieces along a line to an adjacent empty point.
</p>

<h2>Flying</h2>
<p>
A player who has <b>exactly 3</b> pieces left on the board can “fly”: 
On each turn, pick up up one of your pieces and put it on an empty position 
<b>anywhere</b> on the board.<br/>
If the other player still has <b>more than 3</b> pieces on the board, he/she
continues to move pieces as mentioned above.
</p>

<h2>Strategy tip</h2>
<p>
Move a piece from a closed mill to open it. On your next turn 
close it again and remove an opponent's piece.
The opponent may interfere by moving a piece into the gap of 
the opened mill.
