<h1>Alquerque (ancient checkers)</h1>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<img src="alquerque.svg" class="right" style="width: 30%;"/>

<p>
“<b>El Qirkat</b>”, Arabic <b>القرقات</b>, came to medieval Europe via Spain. 
In France adapted to chessboard, leading to modern draughts/checkers.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
 <li><b>2</b> Players - <b>12</b> pieces each - black / white</li>
 <li>Board has 25 <b>points</b> (where lines meet)</li>
 <li>Initial game board setup as shown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
Capture or lock in all of the opponent’s pieces. 
The game ends when a player has no pieces left or cannot make any moves.
</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>
<p>
Players take turns, each time using only one of their pieces:
<ul>
 <li>If possible, <b>capture</b> a single immediately adjacent opposing piece: <b>Jump</b> over it along a straight line, land on the empty point right behind it.</li>
 <li>Your piece may <b>capture additional pieces</b> by doing a sequence of such straight immediate jumps over single pieces, possibly changing directions ("zig-zag").</li>
 <li><b>Remove</b> captured pieces from the game. If no opposing pieces are left, you win.</li>
 <li>If you cannot capture, <b>move</b> a piece one step along a line to an empty point.</li>
 <li>If you cannot even move any of your pieces, the other player wins.</li>
 <li><b>Note</b>: It is not allowed to jump over your own pieces.</p>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>"End game"</h2>
<p>
As soon as only <b>8 pieces</b> are left on the board, the game moves to the <b>inner 3x3 square</b>:
<ul>
 <li>If any of your pieces is on a point on the <b>edge</b> of the board, you may <b>not</b> play pieces on the inner square.
     You must make a move or capture jump from an edge point to one of the 9 inner points of the board. 
     If that's impossible, skip a turn.
 </li>
 <li>Nobody may go to any of the 16 edge points anymore, not even temporarily during a jump sequence.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Differences to checkers</h2>
<ul>
 <li>You may jump or move along lines in any direction, including “backwards”.</li>
 <li>There are no “kings”, and no “crowning” when reaching the far end of the board.</li>
</ul>
