<h2>Setup</h2>

 <li>Player <b>G</b> has <b>20</b> goats (white), off the board.</li>
 <li>Player <b>T</b> has <b>4</b> tigers (black) on corner points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<h2>Goats placing phase</h2>
<ul>
 <li>G starts by placing a goat on a point on the board.</li>
 <li>T <b>moves</b> a tiger one step along a line or <b>captures</b> a goat by jumping over it along a line. 
     Captured goats are <b>removed</b> and stay off the board for the rest of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Repeat the above, until all goats were placed on the board.<br/>
During this phase goats are <b>not</b> allowed to move.
</p>

<h2>Goats moving phase</h2>
<p>
When all goats were placed, player G starts to <b>move</b> a goat on each turn. 
Goats can move one step along a line on the board.
</p>
<p>
Player T continues to move a tiger or jump over a goat on each turn, just as before.
</p>

<h2>Jumping rules</h2>
<ul>
 <li>A tiger can only jump over one goat, landing on the empty point right behind it.</li>
 <li>Tigers cannot jump over tigers.</li>
 <li>Tigers do not have to jump.</li> 
 <li>Goats cannot jump at all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategy hints</h2>
<p>
Goats should initially be placed on safe points on the edge of the board.<br/>
Goats next to each other on the board edge protect each other.
